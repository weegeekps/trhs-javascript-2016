  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Assigning Pok&eacute;mon to Tiles</h2>

  <p>Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
  (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
  classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
  raise your hand to let them know.</p>

  <h3>What's Next?</h3>

  <p>
    The next thing we need to do is to figure out which Pok&eacute;mon will be
    placed on which tiles. To do this, we will write code into the
    <code>assignPokemonToTiles</code> function in our JavaScript file. But
    before we do that, we need to talk about our strategy for storing the
    Pok&eacute;mon information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our tiles are laid out in a two-dimensional fashion (four rows by four
    columns). However, in order to make things easier for us, our Pok&eacute;mon
    information will be stored in a one-dimensional list. This basically means
    we will have 16 Pok&eacute;mon names in one array, and every title will have
    to know which index to use to match up with its Pok&eacute;mon information.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, we will add index information to our tiles in the
    <code>renderTiles</code> function, so that we can use it later on. Then we
    will create our list of Pok&eacute;mon.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Step 1</h3>

  <p>
    Inside <code>renderTiles</code>, we need to make two changes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Add an <code>index</code> variable at the beginning of the function</li>
    <li>Set the index on each tile as we create it, and increment the index</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    First, let's create our <code>index</code> variable. We will use a
    <code>let</code> declaration because we will be changing the value as we
    create our tiles. This declaration should go before anything else in the
    <code>renderTiles</code> function.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>

  <p>
    Now that we have created our <code>index</code> variable, we will use it
    and increment it as we create tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside your <i>inner for loop</i>, after we create the <code>$tile</code>
    but before we append it to <code>$tileRow</code>, we need to set our index
    on the tile.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can do this setting a <code>data-index</code> attribute on each tile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Add these lines between when we create the <code>$tile</code> variable and
    when we append it to <code>$tileRow</code>:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
    $tile.attr("data-index", index);
    index += 1;
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Make sure to save all files and refresh your preview to make sure we haven't
    broken anything.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>
    The next thing we need to do is to come up with a list of our Pok&eacute;mon
    names. We will have 8 Pok&eacute;, each of which will appear in two
    different tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the jQuery function at the very top (above <code>renderTiles</code>),
    let's declare a variable representing our Pok&eacute;mon names. Since we
    have to name each Pok&acute;mon twice, the simplest way to do this is to
    just name them explicitly:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
$(function () {
  const pokemonNames = [
    "blastoise", "blastoise",
    "charizard", "charizard",
    "dragonite", "dragonite",
    "gengar", "gengar",
    "magikarp", "magikarp",
    "mew", "mew",
    "pikachu", "pikachu",
    "venusaur", "venusaur"
  ];

  // functions such as renderTiles
});
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>

  <p>
    Now that we have our main source of Pok&eacute;mon names, we need to assign
    those Pok&eacute;mon randomly to our tiles. We will do this in the
    <code>assignPokemonToTiles</code> function.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, let's create another variable, just below pokemonNames. This variable
    will contain the actual Pok&eacute;mon tile assignments.
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let pokemonTiles;</code-block>

  <p>
    Inside <code>assignPokemonToTiles</code>, we will start by creating a copy
    of the <code>pokemonNames</code> variable and assigning it to
    <code>pokemonTiles</code>. We use a function called <code>slice()</code> to
    do that:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">pokemonTiles = pokemonNames.slice();</code-block>

  <p>
    Then we need to <i>shuffle</i> the pokemonTiles array. This is where our
    <code>shuffle</code> function comes in. We will give you the code for
    shuffling an array:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
function shuffle(array) {
    let counter = array.length;

    // While there are elements in the array
    while (counter > 0) {
        // Pick a random index
        let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * counter);

        // Decrease counter by 1
        counter--;

        // And swap the last element with it
        let temp = array[counter];
        array[counter] = array[index];
        array[index] = temp;
    }

    return array;
}
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Then make sure to call <code>shuffle</code> on the <code>pokemonTiles</code>
    array.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your <code>assignPokemonToTiles</code> function should look like this:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
function assignPokemonToTiles() {
  pokemonTiles = pokemonNames.slice();
  shuffle(pokemonTiles);
}
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>

  <p>
    Now we need to use <code>.data</code> to ensure that each tile knows what
    Pok&eacute;mon it holds.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to do this, we will use a <code>for</code> loop and iterate over
    <code>pokemonTiles</code>. We will use jQuery's <code>.data()</code>
    function for this. (We could just assign the Pok&eacute;mon names as CSS
    classes, but that means anyone can use Chrome Developer Tools to cheat!)
  </p>

  <p>
    Write a <code>for</code> loop that goes from zero to
    <code>gridSize * gridSize</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside that loop, we want to look up the tile with the same index. This is
    done using a selector we haven't covered yet called an attribute selector.
    Below is what we need to put in the loop:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
    var $tile = $("[data-index=" + i + "]");
    $tile.data("pokemon", pokemonTiles[i]);
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>

  <p>
    Make sure the page still works. When you are done, raise your hand so that
    Adam or Kevin can check on your work and make sure you're good to start the
    next section.
