  <h1>Using jQuery</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
  <p>
    <b>jQuery</b> is a JavaScript library that we can use to do some cool
    manipulation of HTML pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In programming, a <b>library</b> is just code that is written for other
    programmers&mdash;in other words, code that helps <i>you</i> write code.
    Libraries are mostly composed of functions (remember those?) that you can
    call in order to do some useful task.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Why jQuery?</h3>
  
  <p>
    jQuery specializes in manipulating HTML pages. This means we can create or
    edit content on the fly, perhaps in response to a user interacting with our
    page in some way.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    jQuery is very popular and very widely used, so learning jQuery will be very
    useful if you want to continue writing web applications after you have
    finished this class.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you wanted to know why the library is written "jQuery", we don't know.
    Maybe they thought was the cool way to name libraries back in the day.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Using JavaScript Libraries in HTML</h2>
  
  <p>
    Remember how we had to pull in external stylesheets using a special HTML
    tag? We need to go through a similar process here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To pull in a JavaScript library or script, we need to use the
    <code>script</code> tag. It takes a <code>src</code> element, which should
    be a URL pointing to the script in question.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes, a popular library is made available on a <b>content delivery
    network</b>. (A content delivery network is basically a web service that
    stores code libraries on servers in a bunch of regions and countries and
    makes sure that users in those regions get the code library from the nearest
    server.) jQuery has its own content delivery network, so we can just use it
    to get a copy of jQuery onto our pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of how to get jQuery onto your HTML page:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h2>jQuery in Action</h2>
  
  <p>
    So how does jQuery actually work? We've said it allows you to manipulate
    parts of your HTML document, but how does it do that?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    jQuery's basic approach is actually similar to how CSS works. Web browsers
    process CSS rules by using their selectors to find matching elements, and
    then applying style properties to those elements. jQuery allows you to use
    selectors in order to select elements, which can then be traversed or
    modified as needed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
$("p")                    // &lt;-- Selects all paragraphs on the page
  .css("color", "red");   // &lt;-- Turns them red
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    As you can see, the example above does two things: selects some elements,
    and then makes a change. In this case, it changes a CSS style property on
    each paragraph element.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will now explore some different use cases for manipulating HTML elements
    with jQuery. Specifically, we will focus on:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Using jQuery as the page loads</li>
    <li>Using jQuery in response to user interaction</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Using jQuery as the page loads</h3>
  
  <p>
    If you want to manipulate the page as soon as it has finished loading, you
    can do so by wrapping your code in a jQuery document loaded check. Here is
    an example of what that looks like:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;This is one last paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
      $(function () {
        $("p").css("color", "red");
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    The most important thing in this example is the use of <code>$</code> right
    at the beginning of the script block, where we pass in a
    <code>function</code> declaration which contains our CSS manipulation.
    The <code>$</code> function, when given a <b>callback function</b> as an
    argument, will wait until the page is fully loaded and ready to go before
    executing the code inside the function. This is super important and must
    always be done before doing any jQuery selectors or manipulation. A good
    rule of thumb is, every line of jQuery must be wrapped inside a call to the
    <code>$</code> function.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Using jQuery in response to user interaction</h3>
  
  <p>
    Okay, it's pretty boring to just change all paragraphs at the same time,
    and we could have just used CSS. Let's make things more interesting. What
    if we want to leave our paragraphs their normal color, but turn them red if
    the user clicks on them?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's how we can do that:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;This is one last paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
      $(function () {
        $("p").on("click", function () {    // When a paragraph is clicked...
          $(this).css("color", "red");      // Get the clicked paragraph, set its color to red
        };
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h1>Exercises</h1>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Run this jQuery snippet: <code>$("p").css("color", "red");</code> on
      <a href="http://jquery.com">jquery.com</a>. What type of style does this
      create: inline, embedded, or external? How do you know? (Hint: Look at
      the HTML source of the page using Chrome developer tools.)
    </li>
  </ol>
