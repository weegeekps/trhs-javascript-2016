  <h1>Setup</h1>
  
  <p>
    We will be using <b>Cloud9</b> as our development environment. Cloud9 is an
    awesome web-based development environment that you can access from anywhere.
    We even used it in order to prepare curriculum for this class at home,
    work, and elsewhere.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One drawback of Cloud9 is that they ask for a credit card number on sign-up,
    even for us as we use their free plan. So we will be creating an account on
    <b>GitHub</b> in order to work around that. GitHub is a cloud-based
    <i>source control tool</i>, but we won't be using it very much in this class
    except as a way of signing onto Cloud9.
  </p>
  
  <p class="aside">
    If you're wondering what's with all these mentions of clouds, this is
    because <i>the cloud</i> refers to websites and remote file storage systems
    that allow us to do our work remotely. The Cloud9 website's name is a pun
    on the expression <i>on cloud nine</i>, which refers to a feeling of
    contentment or happiness.

  <p>
    Here are the things we need to do in order to get ready to code:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Create a GitHub account</li>
    <li>Use the GitHub account to sign onto Cloud9</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Creating a GitHub Account</h2>
  
  <p>
    Follow these steps to create an account on GitHub:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>.</li>
    <li>
      Fill out the signup form on the home page with a username, your e-mail
      address, and a password.
    </li>
    <li>Select the Free plan, and click "Finish sign up".</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Next, you will have a chance to verify your e-mail address. Please make sure
    to do this step, as you will not be able to authorize Cloud9 using your
    GitHub account if you don't do this.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Make sure to stay signed in</b> to GitHub for the next set of steps.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Signing up for Cloud9</h2>
  
  <p>
    Follow these steps to create an account on Cloud9:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <code>http://c9.io</code>.</li>
    <li>
      Click the cat icon near the upper right corner.
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the upper right corner, look for a white circle surrounding an
          outline of a cat. (When you mouse over it, it should say "Sign in with
          GitHub".)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You may be redirected to GitHub and asked to sign in there. If so, sign in
      with the username and password you created on that site.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may be asked to authorize Cloud9 to use your GitHub account. If so,
      click the button that authorizes Cloud9 to use your GitHub account.
    </li>
  </ol>
