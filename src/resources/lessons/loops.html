  <h1>Loops</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In this lesson we are learning about another essential <b>control
  structure</b> in the JavaScript programming language. A <b>loop</b> is a
  sequence of instructions that are repeated until a condition is reached. If
  you've used other programming languages such as C++ or Java before, you may
  be familiar with some of these loops. Before we can dive in however, we first
  must briefly discuss our first <b>formal structure</b>, the
  <code>array</code></p>

  <h2>Arrays</h2>

  <p><b>Arrays</b> are one of the most common structures in computer science,
  and easily one of the most useful in a programmer's toolkit. They can hold a
  series of objects that we can <b>iterate</b> through with our loops. Declaring
  <b>arrays</b> in JavaScript is very easy.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">const myPets = ['cat', 'dog'];</code-block>

  <p>The code example above declares an array with a length of 2. In order to
  access <b>values</b> within our array we can use the following syntax:</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">console.log(myPets[1]); // Prints 'dog'</code-block>

  <p>Note that the the number between the brackets ([ and ]) is called an
  <b>index</b>. The index of an array is <b>zero-based</b>, where 0 refers to
  the first value in an array. In our <code>myPets</code> array, our dog is in
  the second position, so in order to access that value we must use 1. If this
  seems confusing, give it some time and it will begin to make sense. Practice
  will make this easier.</p>

  <!-- While -->
  <h2>While</h2>

  <p>The <code>while</code> loop is the most basic loop that we can use in
  JavaScript. <b>While</b> loops take a <b>condition</b> and continue to perform the
  actions within it's <b>block</b> as long as the condition evaluates to true.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let iterator = 0;

while (iterator < myPets.length) {
  iterator += 1;
  console.log(myPets[iterator]);
}

// Output is:
//   cat
//   dog</code-block>

  <p>When using a <code>while</code> loop with a conditional it's important to
  make sure to increment your iterator. If you don't you can end up in a
  situation where you have an <b>infinite loop</b>! When this happens, you will
  crash your user's environment or browser.</p>

  <p>Another important part about <code>while</code> loops is that the condition
  is <b>evaluated</b> <i>before</i> the block is executed. What if we want to
  evaluate a condition <i>after</i> we execute our block?</p>

  <!-- Do While -->
  <h2>Do While</h2>

  <p>For situations where we want to evaluate our condition after we execute
  our code we can use a <code>do-while</code> loop. These are identical to
  <code>while</code> loops except that the block executes before the condition
  is evaluated.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let iterator = 0;

do {
  iterator += 1;
  console.log(myPets[iterator]);
} while (iterator < myPets.length)

// Output is:
//   dog
//   undefined</code-block>

  <p>That's not right! The output should have been <i>cat</i> and <i>dog</i>!
  However we <b>incremented</b> our iterator prior to attempting to print out
  our pets. On the first call to <code>console.log</code> the value of iterator
  is actually 1 rather than 0. We can fix this by simply moving our call to
  increment below our <code>console.log</code> call.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let iterator = 0;

do {
  console.log(myPets[iterator]);
  iterator += 1;
} while (iterator < myPets.length)

// Output is:
//   cat
//   dog</code-block>

  <!-- For -->
  <h2>For</h2>

  <p>The last kind of loop we're going to look at is the <code>for</code> loop.
  This loop is likely the most used loop and easily the most versatile. It works
  identical to the while loop in that it evaluates the condition before executing
  the block of code, but it provides a shorter syntax that is easier to type and
  read. It also provides <b>scoping</b> for our iterator, so we can reuse it.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">// A common convention is to use i for the iterator in for loops.

for (let i = 0; i < myPets.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(myPets[i]);
}

// Output is:
//   cat
//   dog</code-block>

  <p>In the code example above we have declared a <code>for</code> loop that
  performs identically to our <code>while</code> loop. In the first line we see
  3 pieces passed in; first a declaration of what we want to use as an iterator.
  Second, we declare our condition for running, this is identical to the
  condition we used before. Finally we have our increment call.</p>

  <p>With a <code>for</code> loop we can always rest assured that our iterator
  will always be incremented <i>after</i> our work is complete, so we can avoid
  situations like we had with the <code>do while</code> loop.</p>
